abstract: This review of Alberto Acerbi's Cultural Evolution in The Digital Age provides a brief summary of the book and weighs its potential to impact media studies as a whole. Acerbi intertwines cultural evolution and cognitive anthropology to study the impact of the digital age on human behavior. Unlike digital doomsayers, Acerbi downplays the negative impact of digital media on our culture and social life and provides a solid, science-based take on the issue, which I argue should be more frequently featured in syllabi of media and cultural studies.
