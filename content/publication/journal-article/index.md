The aim of the thesis is to provide an overview of three contemporary action films:
Dredd 3D, John Wick, and Mad Max: Fury Road, through a so-called "bio-structuralist"
approach - combining archetypal criticism, literary Darwinism, and narratology, into a unified,
holistic theoretical model.
The thesis is divided in four main parts: (1) an introduction, that gives a rationale for the
aim, scope, and the design of the thesis, (2) a theoretical framework, which provides both an
overview of the theories and fits them in the general model, (3) a part including the case studies,
that puts the theoretical approach to the test, and finally (4) a conclusion that gives a verdict on
the feasibility of the model and summarizes the findings.
A particular emphasis is put on the monomyth as a story paradigm that all the films in the
case studies share, whose combination of a biologically dictated scaffolding, and cultural
brickwork, is an excellent testing ground for the theoretical model.
In addition to the attempts of revealing glimpses of our evolved nature in the plots,
narrative conventions, cinematography, themes, motivations, settings, and character networks in
the films, the thesis attempts to balance the hardliner literary Darwinist stance of the dominance
of biology over culture, with an acknowledgement of the existence of cultural transmission and
stylistic evolution. Thus, the thesis proposes terminology that differentiates between cultural
units totally dominated by biology, partially tied to it, and completely independent of it, albeit
spread in ways reminiscent of biological evolution.
The proposed theoretical model is shown to be a viable alternative to post-structuralist
approaches as far as the study of action cinema is concerned, with its ample scope serving as its
principal advantage.
