abstract: Hypothetical encounters between humans and alien civilizations have been a hallmark of science fiction since the inception of the genre. However, the accompanying transformation of human society in these narratives has been largely neglected in critical analyses, especially by those that fit under the "cognitive" moniker. This paper fill this gap, by comparing how the aftermath of first contact is treated in novels by the "Big Three" of mid-twentieth century science fiction - Clarke (Childhood's End), Asimov (The Gods Themselves), and Heinlein (Stranger in a Strange Land). The paper argues that the stucture of first contact in this narratives is deliberately crafted to appeal to both contemporary cultural (mainly Cold War related) anxieties, and to hard-wired biological biases. The upshot of first contact in these novels is always hyper sociality — for better or worse. In addition, their success hinges on the depiction of a post humanist perspective — focusing either on aliens or on "altered" humans. The paper also featured a "lightweight" sentiment analysis, using Matthew Jockers' "syuzhet" package, which revealed the emotional valence of the post-event transformation of humanity.

summary: First contact narratives in mid-20th century science fiction were not only commonplace, but displayed certain similarities. I argue that the interplay between Cold War cultural anxieties and certain cognitive biases contributed towards the popularity of a unique variation of the first contact trope.
