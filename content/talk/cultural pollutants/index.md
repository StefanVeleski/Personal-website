abstract: In this presentation, I test the general hypothesis that a significant factor in the "cultural death" of late Victorian bestsellers is the presence of "cultural pollutants" (retrospectively, a better term would have been "transmission blockers") in their textual fabric. "Cultural pollutants" are inherent properties of the text linked to the zeitgeist of a particular period that block its vertical cultural transmission across time to new generations of readers — they neatly fit the cultural tastes of a certain period or generation but prevent the novel to thrive when these tastes change. As such, they are direct opposites to Dan Sperber’s "cultural attractors", aspects of the cultural product that facilitate its transmission. Textual features of the texts of the novels are "operationalized" as proxies for three types of "cultural pollutants": (1) Linguistic complexity, measured through the token-type ratio of the text — the initial hypothesis is that a higher TTR would be correlated with lower success, (2) Named entity ratio, indicating the level of saturation with concepts inextricably linked to the sociocultural context of the novels (i.e. references to places, people, professions that are no longer relevant or no longer exist) — the hypothesis is that a higher NER would correlate with lower success, (3) Dialogic liveliness — a basic measure of the proportion of dialogues in the texts (number of utterances/number of words) — the hypothesis is that a lower dialogic liveliness would correlate with lower success.

summary: The popularity of late Victorian novels in the present day is characterized by extreme inequality. This paper tests the hypothesis that some novels that were bestsellers upon publication failed to linger in the collective memory of subsequent generations of readers due to "cultural pollutants", or "transmission blockers" — elements of the text filled with contemporary context that hinder the cultural transmission of the novels across time.

Presentation slides available upon request! I am currently trying to rerun some of the analyses of this paper using additional data and fit it in my dissertation. I am open for any suggestions, especially for other "cultural pollutants" or "transmission blockers", and how these can be "operationalized".
