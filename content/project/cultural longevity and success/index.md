This project, which makes up most of my dissertation research, is concerned with the factors that contribute towards different rates of decay of the collective memory and attention that cultural products are able to attract. Informed by cultural evolution and biocultural criticism, my approach heavily relies on methods from the computational humanitiesâ€”a crucial aspect being "operationalizing" or quantifying, measuring, analyzing, and visualizing cultural data. Most of this research is currently targeted at late Victorian novels (which is my dissertation topic), but the insight gotten from this research is not medium specific and can be applied to other cultural products as well.
