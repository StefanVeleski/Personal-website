Cultural anxieties have long been a subject of interest for literary studies, but research on this topic has been bogged down into cyclical non-empirical debates centered on post-structuralist philosophy. My approach to the analysis of cultural anxieties relies on biocultural criticism and cultural evolution. Cultural phenomena can indeed influence human behavior, a subset of which is the production of cultural products, but the relationship between cultural context and behavior is much
To see a preliminary quantification of the factors that contribute towards the spreading of cultural anxieties see the article Crisis and Transformation: The Aftermath of First Contact in Three Mid-20th Century Science Fiction Novels, published in the 8th edition of Aigne, published by College of Arts, Celtic Studies and Social Sciences at University College Cork.
